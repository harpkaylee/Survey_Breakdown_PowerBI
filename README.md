# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to familarize myself with PowerBI and apply the skills I have learned to a new software. I originally cleaned the data in PowerBI with power query however there are many limitations, so I utilized Excel to preprocess and cleanse the dataset, transforming raw data by handling unusable columns through advanced data manipulation techniques. Then Power BI was used to refine data processing, perform additional transformations, and develop dynamic visualizations for comprehensive analysis of the survey results.
