# Project Overview
The primary goal of this project was to familarize myself with PowerBI and apply the skills I have learned to a new software. I originally cleaned the data in PowerBI with power query however there are many limitations, so I utilized Excel to preprocess and cleanse the dataset, transforming raw data by handling unusable columns through advanced data manipulation techniques. Then Power BI was used to refine data processing, perform additional transformations, and develop dynamic visualizations for comprehensive analysis of the survey results.

After getting a good preliminary look at the data, I wanted to looked farther into and showcase certain information from the survey data. Above is the first page of visualizations I created. I first felt it necessary to compare the job titles and the average salary of each person in the position, and then look at the overall happiness with their salary and management on a scale from 1 to 10 with 10 being the best ever. The results got me curious, what about those surveyors who make more than 60,000? Are they just as unsatisfied with management and the salary? This was looked at in more depth in the next visualization page.

Everyone has a favorite programming language that they enjoy more than others and Python was the favorite across many of the job titles as shown in the stacked column chart. Lastely I found it important to see the opinions of the surveyors who joined a data focused job after working a different field and the results show that the majority were in the middle on it being difficult/easy as shown in the pie chart.

The improvement of happiness scores with salary increased substantially when filtering out the individuals who make less than 60,000 a year. The happiness with management did not have a substantial difference, therefore most surveyors found management to be subpar/ average. Looking at the stacked area chart, I wondered if the education level of the surveyors had an effect on the question asking what would be most important to them if looking for a new job today. Knowing that the majority of the population does not have a masters or PhD and therefore those education levels likely have less people to represent, the majority with a bachelor's degree would look for a better salary. Looking at the other possible areas of importance, the surveyors with a masters degree would look for a better work/life balance than working remotely.
Breaking into Data from the first set of graphs has been broken down farther to look at how gender played a role in the difficulty. Ignoring the numbers at first, both men and female had the same trends with the answers. The majority were in the middle of difficulty, then difficult, easy, and so forth.
